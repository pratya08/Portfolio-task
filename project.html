                <p>Women are key in maintaining healthy families and access the health system more than men, both for themselves and on behalf of their children. Many become pregnant and give birth, a significant health event, then typically become their child’s primary caregiver, a role that greatly influences household health overall. Elder and long-term care issues affect women more often because they live longer; have higher rates of disability and chronic health problems; and lower incomes than men on average, which puts them at greater need for state and community resources, such as Medicaid.Across her lifespan, a woman’s health status matters to herself but more to her family ,so it is essential to that they have sound mind and body .
